Make a card game in Python like the card game war

cards
deck
2 players

- make a deck of 52 cards,
- in that deck, put 2 - A of each suit ♥️ ♠️ ♣️ ♦️
- deal cards out to each player one at a time until all are gone
- players throw down top card face up 
-if cards are the same value,
 deal out 3 cards each the one more face up, compare again
- if not the same, player with higher card value gets the pile
play stops when one player runs of cards, other player wins
