''' The elif clause executes if age < 12 is True and name == 'Alice' is False.
However, if both of the conditions are False, 
then both of the clauses are skipped. 
It is not guaranteed that at least one of the clauses will be executed. 
When there is a chain of elif statements, 
only one or none of the clauses will be executed.
Once one of the statementsâ€™ conditions is found to be True, 
the rest of the elif clauses are automatically skipped.'''
