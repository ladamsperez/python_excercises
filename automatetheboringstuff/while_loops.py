# Letâ€™s look at an if statement 
# and a while loop that use the same condition 
# and take the same actions based on that condition. 
# Here is the code with an if statement:
# spam = 0
# if spam < 5:
#     print('Hello, world.')
#     spam = spam + 1

spam = 0
while spam < 5:
    print('Hello, world.')
    spam = spam + 1
